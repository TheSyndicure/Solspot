# How to register a domain name

## To Start

Head to the [Bonfida Marketplace](https://naming.bonfida.org/#/auctions)

In the search bar type the name of the .sol domain you would like to use and hit enter, in this example, we are using 'cabbages', the length of the name will determine the cost of registering the domain, check [Domain Costs](domain-costs.md) for pricing.

When it has finished searching you will have the following displayed on your screen if it is available to purchase it will show available in the bottom left of the card, if someone already owns it you will see 'unavailable' and the owner's wallet will be on the right side.

After you click on the domain you will be greeted by two screens one after the other displaying the chosen domain, confirm your spelling, and click 'register domain' to continue.

Ensure your wallet is connected. Select the currency you would like to use to purchase your domain from the dropdown menu, [you can buy FIDA HERE](https://raydium.io/swap/?inputCurrency=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v\&outputCurrency=EchesyfXePKdLtoiZSL8pBe8Myagyy8ZRqsACNCFGnvp\&outputAmount=0\&fixed=in) or use the built-in swap function (not recommended).

Select the domain space you would like to assign to your domain and click next.\
The space is the amount of storage allocated to your domain, if you plan to use the messaging services available such as Jabber, choose a higher storage size, the larger the storage you choose the higher the gas fee will be. [For more info check here.](https://docs.bonfida.org/collection/domain-space)

![Once you have selected the appropriate space click “Next”.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

Confirm you have the correct amount of FIDA and SOL to pay for the domain and hit confirm.

![Click confirm to send the transaction to your wallet for approval](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png>)

Your wallet will pop up with the final price and fees, hit approve/confirm in your wallet and you are done!

You will be taken to your newly purchased domain screen which will look like this:

![Congratulations you are done!](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

That is it, you are done and now own a .sol domain, you will be able to give other people this name and they will be able to send you any SOL assets using it, if you would like to send me a coffee for the guide, feel free to send some SOL/USDC to cabbages.sol
