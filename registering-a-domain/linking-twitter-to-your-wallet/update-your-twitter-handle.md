# Update your Twitter handle

Navigate to the [Twitter registration page ](https://naming.bonfida.org/#/twitter-registration)via the main menu on Bonafida.

This time do not click the 'Claim Twitter handle', instead type the Twitter handle you would like to change in the search field on this page and hit enter (all lower case, no capitals).

You will then have your details appear like the below screenshot, click the 'Delete' option, approve the transaction and then you are done.

Then go through the [linking process](./) to either relink the same handle to a new wallet or link a new handle to the same or new wallet.
